To use, clone the repo, open your terminal, `cd` into the project root, and run `npm install`.

Once installation is complete, run `npm run-script ex1` to run the tests for exercise 1. `ex2`, `ex3`, and `ex4` run tests for each of the other exercises. The script will watch the exercise directory for changes and re-run the tests whenever you edit the code.
